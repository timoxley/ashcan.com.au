<h1>Site Update!</h1>
<p>Welcome to the new Ashcan site!  We're really happy to have a more streamlined site which has all our comics available for digital and physical purchase.  Thanks to Tim Oxley for setting up for us, much appreciated.</p>
<p>We will soon have a webcomic section!  Check out some free comics from Brisbane-based artists and writers, drop us a line if you'd like to get some content of your on there too.</p>
<p>Supernova's less than a week away, the Ashcan team is excited and we can't wait to see you there.</p>
