      <p>Welcome to the new Ashcan site!  We're really happy to have a more
      streamlined site which has all our comics available for digital and
      physical purchase. Thanks to <a href="http://www.twitter.com/secoif">Tim Oxley</a> for setting up for us, much appreciated.</p>
      <p>We will soon have a webcomic section!  You will be able to check out
      free comics from Brisbane-based artists and writers. Drop us a line if you'd like to get some content of your on there too.</p>
      <p>Supernova's less than a week away, the Ashcan team is excited and we can't wait to see you there.</p>
